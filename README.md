# Image Sonification

A web application that converts images to audio (WAV) files and reconstructs images from sound.

## What is Sonification?

Sonification is the process of converting data from one form (in this case, visual data from images) into sound. Each pixel's color and position is mapped to specific audio frequencies and characteristics, creating a unique sound representation of the image.

## What This Project Does

This application allows you to:
- Convert images to audio (WAV) files
- Reconstruct images from audio files
- Play the generated audio and visualize the waveform

## Motivation

The initial motivation for this project was to understand compression algorithms and explore whether images could be stored in audio format. During this exploration, I discovered the field of sonification and decided to build a project that demonstrates this concept by converting visual data into sound and back again.
